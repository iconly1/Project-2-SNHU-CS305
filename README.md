# CS-305: Software Security Portfolio Submission  

## **Artifact: Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report**  

### **Client Overview**  
Artemis Financial is a financial services company that required a security assessment of its software. The company needed an analysis of vulnerabilities and recommendations for secure coding practices.  

### **What I Did Well**  
I successfully identified software vulnerabilities and provided a structured mitigation plan. Secure coding is essential in protecting sensitive financial data and reducing security risks for businesses.  

### **Challenges & Learnings**  
One challenge was ensuring that all vulnerabilities were properly identified and verified. This experience strengthened my ability to assess security threats and apply best practices in remediation.  

### **Security Enhancements & Future Use**  
I implemented security measures like input validation, encryption, and access control. In future assessments, I plan to use tools such as OWASP ZAP and Veracode for automated security testing.  

### **Ensuring Functionality & Security**  
After refactoring the code, I conducted testing to confirm no new vulnerabilities were introduced. The verification process included both manual review and security tools.  

### **Useful Tools & Practices**  
- **OWASP Top 10** for best security practices  
- **GitHub** for version control and documentation  
- **Secure coding principles** such as least privilege and input sanitization  

### **Value to Employers**  
This project showcases my ability to perform security assessments, identify vulnerabilities, and apply secure coding techniquesâ€”essential skills for software development and cybersecurity roles.
